# Chapter 1: Data and Statistics
======================

## 1.1 Applications in Business and Economics

* Accounting: Public accounting firms use statistical sampling procedures when conducting audits for their
clients.

* Finance: Financial analysts use a variety of statistical information to guide their investment recommendations.

* Marketing: Electronic scanners at retail checkout counters collect data for a variety of marketing research
applications.

* Production: Todayâ€™s emphasis on quality makes quality control an important application of statistics
in production.

* Economics: Economists frequently provide forecasts about the future of the economy or some aspect of it.
They use a variety of statistical information in making such forecasts.

## 1.2 Data

### 1.2.1 Element, Variable Observation

* Element: The entities on which data are collected.

* Variable: A characteristic of interest for the elements.

* Observation: Measurements collected on each variable for every element in a study provide the data. The
set of measurements obtained for a particular element

### 1.2.2 Scales of Measurement

* Nominal scale: When the data for a variable consist of labels or names used to identify an attribute of
the element.

* Ordinal scale: if the data exhibit the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful.(Ordinal data can also be provided using a numeric code)

* Interval scale: if the data have all the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure.(Interval data are always numeric.)

* Ratio scale: if the data have all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful.

### 1.2.3 Categorical and Quantitative Data

* Categorical data: Data that can be grouped by specific categories(Categorical data use either the nominal or ordinal scale of measurement.)

* Quantitative data: Data that use numeric values to indicate how much or how many.(Quantitative data are obtained using either the interval or ratio scale of measurement.)

* The statistical analysis appropriate for a particular variable depends upon whether the variable is categorical or quantitative.

* Categorical variable: A variable with categorical data.

* Quantitative variable: A variable with quantitative data

### 1.2.4 Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data

* Cross-sectional data: data collected at the same or approximately the same point in time.

* Time series data: data collected over several time periods.

## 1.3 Data Sources

### 1.3.1 Existing Sources

* In some cases, data needed for a particular application already exist.

### 1.3.2 Statistical Studies

* Sometimes the data needed for a particular application are not available through existing sources.

* In an experimental study, a variable of interest is first identified. Then one or more other variables are identified and controlled so that data can be obtained about how they influence the variable of interest.

### 1.3.3 Data Acquisition Errors

* Be aware of the possibility of data errors in statistical studies through acquiring accurate data can help ensure reliable and valuable decision-making information.

## 1.4 Descriptive Statistics

* Descriptive statistics: The summaries of data, which may be tabular, graphical, or numerical. 

## 1.5 Statistical Inference

* Population: The set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

* Sample: A subset of the population.

* Census: The process of conducting a survey to collect data for the entire population

* Sample survey: The process of conducting a survey to collect data

* Statistical inference: The process of using data obtained from a sample to make estimates or test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population.

## 1.6 Computers and Statistical Analysis

* Minitab and StatTools as the major tool for this book. 

## 1.7 Data Mining

* Data Mining: The process of using procedures from statistics and computer science to extract useful information from extremely large databases.
